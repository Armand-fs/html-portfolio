<p>Greetings from South Africa! I'm Armand van der Merwe. Building on my solid year of hands-on experience in Webflow Development, 
  I am currently dedicating myself to broadening my horizons in the web development landscape.
</p>

<p>I am deep into the "Complete Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy, a comprehensive program that's sculpting me into a well-rounded 
  Full-Stack Web Developer. This course empowers me with expertise in a vast array of both front-end and back-end technologies. 
  From HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript ES6 to backend stalwarts like Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js, I'm sharpening my toolkit. 
  Moreover, I'm venturing into emerging domains, embracing Web3 Development, Blockchain, and more.
</p>

<p>Upon completion, my capabilities will stretch far beyond just development; I will be equipped to craft, optimize, and deploy 
  complete web solutions, whether it's for innovative startups or established giants.
</p>

<p>While my primary trajectory is development-centric, I cherish my foundational skills in UX/UI Design, backed by a year of 
  Webflow development. Figma has been a reliable partner in this journey, enabling me to blend functional designs with aesthetics seamlessly.
</p>

<p>Ready for a digital evolution? Let's harness the power of modern web technologies and elevate your online stature.</p>
